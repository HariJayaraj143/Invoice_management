In the README.md, describe how to run the project:

# E-commerce Listing Page

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

git clone <repo-url> cd ecommerce-listing


2. Install dependencies:

npm install


3. Run the application:

npm start


The application will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Approach

- Created a component-based structure using React.
- Utilized `React Router` for routing between the product listing and thank you page.
- Implemented pagination with static mock data.
- Added modal functionality for "Add to Cart".
